My games is an escape room themed trivia game. At the beginning of the game the player is given the scenario (using print function)
The player is tied up in a room in the middle of a house. The thing that captured the player is on the loose. The object of the game
is for the player to get out of the house safely. The player is asked a series of questions (18 in total). If the player gets the question
right they move on to the next question. If they get it wrong they loop back to the first stage first question. If the player keeps questions
more than 8 times the game is over. If the players gets all 18 questions in a row correct they move onto the next stage. In this stage the
player is fighting the opponent. The player and opponent start with 100 life. The player is asked whether they want to attack. If they attack
the player life and opponent life go down by a random integer. If the player chooses not to attack the game ends and they lose. If the players
life gets to 0 before the opponent the player loses. If the opponent's life gets to 0 first, the player wins.
